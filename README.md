## Data Types

We will be working with 5 main data Types
1. Integer-whole number
2. string-collection of characters
3. Char-1 character
4. Float-decimal number
5. Boolean-True/False (1/8)

## Variable

'myName = "Rhobbe"'

Variable:container, holds a value

### Rule for variable names

1. Always start with a letter

'1name = "Rhobbe" --> NOT ALLOWeD

2. Can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores (_)

'my name = "Rhobbe"--> NOT ALLOWeD

3. if more than one word, use camelcase or underscores to separate words

'myFirstName' 'my_First_Name
